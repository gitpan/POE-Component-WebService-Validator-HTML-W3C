    - Now I feel stupid for making changes in 0.03
        the fails were due to XML::XPath not being
        installed >_<. Oh well, IMO the hashrefs
        are simplier to use than objects in this case.
        Added XML::XPath as prerequisite. Might
        make it optional in later versions

    - FAILs still persist, could not find an issue
        as it tests out perfectly for me. Changed
        {errors} and {warnings} to contain hashrefs
        instead of ::Error and ::Warnings objects.
        Hopefully this will help. Sorry for such 
        a change.
