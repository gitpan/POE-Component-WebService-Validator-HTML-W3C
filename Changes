Revision history for Perl extension POE::Component::WebService::Validator::HTML::W3C.

0.03  Mon Jan 28 06:10:00 2008
    - Now I feel stupid for making changes in 0.03
	the fails were due to XML::XPath not being
	installed >_<. Oh well, IMO the hashrefs
	are simplier to use than objects in this case.
	Added XML::XPath as prerequisite. Might
	make it optional in later versions

    - FAILs still persist, could not find an issue
        as it tests out perfectly for me. Changed
        {errors} and {warnings} to contain hashrefs
        instead of ::Error and ::Warnings objects.
        Hopefully this will help. Sorry for such 
        a change.

    - Got FAILs from CPAN testers, updated
        testsuit to include more verbose
        output if Auto-smoker is used
